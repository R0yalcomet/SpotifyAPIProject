# SpotifyAPI
This is a project assigned from Codecademy. The purpose is to demonstrate usage of React and API's.

## Technologies Used
This project was made using React and the Spotify API.

## Features
Before the app can function, the user must authorize it to access their Spotify account. Once authorized, a user may search Spotify's database for tracks. These tracks can be added to a custom playlist. The user can specify the name of this playlist and remove songs from the playlist. When the user is content with their playlist they can save it directly to their Spotify account.

## Future Work
The following are potential features/changes that may or may not be added.
- [x] include album image in track display
- [] allow audio preview for selected track
- [] change authorization flow to authorization code with PKCE (currently implicit grant)
- [] allow for search filter options

## Codecademy Project Overview
In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

### Project Requirements
- Build a web app using React
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Integrate with Spotify or another API
- Deploy your application
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
    - The purpose of your project
    - Technologies used
    - Features
    - Future work
### Features:
- Users can search for songs by song title.
    - You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
